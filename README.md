# Simon Democko Portfolio
 Data Analyst Portfolio

I began my journey into the field of data as a Mathematics major at University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
Data always fascinated me because of the information you can achieve with the knowledge of how to interpret data to make informed decisions.
Quickly after graduation, I dove into the world of Python and SQL to obtain the skills I would need to be a successful Data Analyst.
This portfolio will showcase the skills I have achieved through my studies by engaging in exciting and informative independent projects.
Please enjoy and I welcome any feedback!
