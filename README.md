# Simon Democko Portfolio
 Data Analyst Portfolio

+I began my journey into the field of data as a Mathematics major at University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
+Data always fascinated me because of the information you can achieve with the knowledge of how to interpret data to make informed decisions.
+Quickly after graduation, I dove into the world of Python and SQL to obtain the skills I would need to be a successful Data Analyst.
+This portfolio will showcase the skills I have achieved through my studies by engaging in exciting and informative independent projects.
+Please enjoy and I welcome any feedback!
